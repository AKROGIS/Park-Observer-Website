            <strong>This app may crash at any time</strong><br />
            Please record what you were doing at the time of the crash and which protocol file you used to 
            create your survey. Send this information to the contact below, so that we can fix the problem.

            <strong>You may lose data</strong><br />
            Emphasis has been placed on ensuring that the data you collect is always saved and safe.
            However, you may lose data, that is why it is still in Beta.
            Please let me know if you experience any loss of data.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>iOS 13+ is required</strong><br />
            The app should work with any version of iOS 13, however all testing to date has been done with
            iOS 13.5 and higher. If you experience problems, please try upgrade to the latest version of
            iOS 13. This app makes extensive use of features that are not available for earlier versions
            of iOS. I'm sorry if you have older devices that will not run iOS 13. You can continue to use
            the old version of Park Observer or purchase newer devices.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Full support for existing files</strong><br />
            Park Observer 2.0 should open and work correctly with any and all files you used with the original
            Park Observer. This includes surveys (*.poz), maps (*.tpk) and protocols (*.obsprot). If you have
            an existing file that is not loading, please send it to us so we can fix the problem
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Minor additions to the protocol file</strong><br />
            Some of the new features require new settings in the protocol file.
            See the <a href="../help2">Help pages</a> for details on the protocol file.
          </li>
