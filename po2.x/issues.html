      <h3 id="bugs">Bugs</h3>
      <h4 id="critical">Critical</h4>
      <p>These bugs create errors in stored data.</p>
      <h4 id="important">Important</h4>
      <p>These bugs limit required functionality.</p>
      <h4 id="nice-to-fix">Nice to fix</h4>
      <p>These bugs can be worked around or ignored.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Getting Error: unable to add point (...) to tracklog: wrongMission (when loading a survey, i.e. building
          tracklogs)</li>
        <li>When waiting on GPS (i.e. exceeds allowable error), hide edit, show cancel, disallow save.</li>
        <li>Do not show attribute editor if no dialog <em>and</em> not angleDistance</li>
        <li>Canceling a mission property dialog when launched from tracklogging or observing button does not cancel
          operation
          only attribute editing.</li>
        <li>Getting the most recent Mission Property (for default) from database does not consider adhoc locations</li>
        <li>Problem with Mission Properties with required values and no editing on start tracklog (values will be null)
        </li>
        <li>When editing multiple features, if one has validation errors when you decide to move another feature, the
          validation interrupts the move</li>
        <li>When exporting, the export date is updated before we know if the export succeeds. If it fails, we need to
          undo the
          export date.</li>
        <li>When returning from background addGpsLocation can be called from cache and from locationManager out of order
        </li>
        <li>Chaos may ensue if the user does not tap on the map when &quot;Moving to map location&quot;; start modal
          mode?
        </li>
        <li>Need to be able to delete status messages when they no longer apply.</li>
        <li>Slide out view does not check width on device rotation (limit to maxWidth as % of screenwidth)</li>
        <li>Refresh the current file list if the slide out is hidden and re-shown</li>
        <li>Alarm does not play alert sound when app is active</li>
        <li>Add notice to turn on notification in settings if denied for alarm setting</li>
        <li>User can provide a unique value renderer for track logs and or gps points, but graphics do not have the
          necessary
          attributes</li>
        <li>The safe area (on devices with safe area - iPhone X and 11) mucks with styling of slide out view</li>
        <li>Transects &quot;required&quot; property should trump the features &quot;allow off transect&quot; property
        </li>
        <li>Mission Properties are not created when start/stop observing, and tracklog = none</li>
        <li>The default mission property &quot;display editor&quot; properties are not appropriate for all cases (i.e.
          tracklog = none)</li>
        <li>ObservationPresenter/Selector title needs to be updated if the feature has a label field and it is edited.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4 id="annoying">Annoying</h4>
      <p>These bugs are related to potential functionality (so while incorrect, they have no impact yet).</p>
      <ul>
        <li>encode(AnyJSON(agsRenderer.toJSON())) converts 0 to false, so result is no longer valid on read</li>
      </ul>
      <h4 id="not-mine">Not mine</h4>
      <p>These issues are in software provided by others (Apple, Esri). If they become a problem, a work around may be
        possible</p>
      <ul>
        <li>TextFields with number formatters can show an invalid value. They do not update the display the return key
          is
          pressed --
          they do not update when moving focus to another control with a screen touch. The data saved will be the last
          valid
          value
          the the user typed. For example if the field limited numbers to 360, and the user typed 2-5-4-3, the display
          would
          show
          2543, but 254 would be saved. The work around is to always press the return key when done editing a number
          field.
        </li>
        <li>Action Sheets on the iPad do not show up in correct location (especially for items at bottom of file list)
          This is a known Apple bug(<a
            href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/61676063/542911">https://stackoverflow.com/q/61676063/542911</a>)</li>
        <li>Background Track Log toggle is settings is not hidden when the user has rejected <em>Always</em>
          (background)
          location authorization.
          The system does not track if <em>Always</em> authorization was requested and rejected. If the app has not
          requested
          <em>Always</em> authorization
          it will have <em>In Use</em>, <em>Denied</em>, or <em>Unknown</em> authorization. If the app has requested
          <em>Always</em> and the user has rejected it,
          the authorization still be one of <em>In Use</em>, <em>Denied</em>, or <em>Unknown</em> authorization.</li>
        <li>Text/Number fields in attribute editing form should get focus when displayed and editable.
          The user should be able to navigate to next/previous Text/Number field with a next/prev key on the on-screen
          keyboard, or
          the tab (shift-tab) keys on a bluetooth keyboard. Unfortunately, this is not supported in SwiftUI (iOS 13 and
          14_beta).
