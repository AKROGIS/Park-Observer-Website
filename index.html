      <h2>Getting Started</h2>

      <p><strong>Park Observer 2.0</strong> is a major improvement over the well-used iPad spatial
        data collection tool used in Alaska for transect based surveys since 2014.
        Park Observer 2.0 is a custom iOS app designed, built and enhanced to better meet the needs
        of its users based on their specific feedback and requests.</p>

      <p>Equally important to the <a href="po2.x/features.html">new features</a> in Park Observer 2.0
        is the ability to maintain it into the future. The original Park Observer was started on iOS 6
        back in 2012, and most of the technology that it was built on has been deprecated and it is no
        longer maintainable.
        Park Observer 2.0 is built with the latest technology in the hope of maximizing it's life.</p>

      <p><a href="downloads2/">Download</a> Park Observer 2.0 and <a href="help2/">get started</a> with
        an all new easy to use spatial data collection tool.</p>
        
      <p>If you are using Park Observer 1.x, you can still access the <a href="po1.x">old website</a>.</p>
