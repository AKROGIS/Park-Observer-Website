        <h2>Getting Started</h2>

        <p>Park Observer 2.0 hopes to address all of the outstanding features that you and other users have requested
        but have been impossible to incorporate into the original Park Observer.  Equally important to the
        <a href="po2.x/features.html">new features</a>
        is the ability to maintain Park Observer 2.0 into the future.  The original Park Observer was started on iOS 6
        back in 2012, and most of the technology that it was built on has been deprecated.  Park Observer 2.0 is
        built with the most current best practices with the hope of maximizing it's life.</p>

        <p>If you are still using Park Observer 1.x, you can still access the <a href="po1.x">old website</a>.</p>
