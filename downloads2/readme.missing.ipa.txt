IPA Files
=========

The IPA files are the iOS instalation files for Park Observer.
They are created in Xcode by the Park Observer code base
and saved on the NPS network drives. 
They are part of the website, but are not part of the website
or Park Observer repositories.
They can be found at:
`T:\PROJECTS\AKR\ParkObserver\website binaries\ipas`
where `T = \\INPAKROVMTEAMS\Teams\GIS`

The sub folders of downloads get an ipa file with the matching
version number, the rest go into the downloads2 folder.
If in doubt, see the `versionlist.json` files in the two
download folders.
