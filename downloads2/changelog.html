      <h2>Change Log</h2>

      <h3 id="beta3">2020-08-21: 2.0.0.beta3</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>On first launch the app selects an online map for the default.</li>
        <li>On first launch the app creates a sample survey and set it as the default.</li>
        <li>Fixed a bug that failed to update labels and symbology when changing attributes from null to non-null</li>
        <li>Fixed a display glitch with the disclosure angle for the details view in survey and protocol lists.</li>
        <li>Fixed a bug where the editor was not presented when creating a new feature at the map touch location.</li>
        <li>Fixed a bug where the track log properties editor was not displayed at the proper times.</li>
        <li>Add default limits of 0..100 on the stepper control (for legacy compatibility).</li>
        <li>Disable the save button when there are no changes.</li>
        <li>Fixed a bug where mission properties at touch location were incorrectly drawn at the gps location.</li>
        <li>Now if you tap to select multiple features, and then delete one, it is removed from the list of selected
          features.
        </li>
        <li>The undo button while editing the survey name was confusing. It is now a &quot;clear text&quot; button and a
          new undo
          button was added.</li>
        <li>Made the totalizer and info banner more visible</li>
        <li>Made the totalizer with fields behave like the old Park Observer (shows total for entire survey not just
          current track
          log)</li>
        <li>The feature selector/presenter now shows the feature id in the title.</li>
        <li>Added support for the gps_interval property in the protocol file</li>
        <li>Provided user settings for GPS filters: accuracy, distance, and duration.</li>
      </ul>

        <li>Added &quot;required&quot; property to attributes. UI Forces user to provide non-null attribute value.</li>
        <li>Added &quot;azimuth/distance&quot; option to location methods (angle is relative to north, not course).</li>
        <li>Fixed bugs with angle/distance forms (start with null, make required and validate).</li>
        <li>App shows a warning when angle is behind you (based on course; only for angle/distance).</li>
        <li>Made the <a href="https://github.com/regan-sarwas/park-observer">github repo</a> public.</li>

        <li>Survey protocol files and archives can now be opened with Park Observer from email and files app (however
