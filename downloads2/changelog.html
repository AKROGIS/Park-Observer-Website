          <li>Fixed bug for incorrect drawing of compass rose button on iOS 14.0.</li>
          <li>Fixed bug where <code>DecimalEntry</code> incorrectly added a stepper when the attribute
            type was an <code>Int16</code>, <code>Int32</code>, or <code>Int64</code>.</li>
          <li><code>DecimalEntry</code> with <code>fractionDigits = 0</code> now correctly display no decimals
            instead of 6.</li>
          <li>Upgraded to version 100.10.0 of the esri <em>ArcGIS Runtime API for iOS</em>.</li>

            could be an error, but I decided otherwise.</li>

            &quot;Survey Info&quot; in attribute editor.</li>

          <li>The feature selector/presenter now shows the feature id in the title.</li>
          <li>Added support for the gps_interval property in the protocol file</li>
