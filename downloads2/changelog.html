      <section id="beta4">
        <h3>2020-??: 2.0.0.beta4</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Added an option in the protocol file to specify label for the start/stop observing button (i.e. "Survey", "Transect").</li>
          <li>Replaced "Mission Properties" with "{observing label} Info", e.g. "Survey Info" in attribute editor.</li>
          <li>Protocol property dialog.title was not used, so it is now optional in the protocol file.</li>
          <li>Fixed bug: protocol feature.label.field must <strong>case_sensitive</strong> match one of feature.attribute.name.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section id="beta3">
        <h3>2020-08-21: 2.0.0.beta3</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>On first launch the app selects an online map for the default.</li>
          <li>On first launch the app creates a sample survey and set it as the default.</li>
          <li>Fixed a bug that failed to update labels and symbology when changing attributes from null to non-null</li>
          <li>Fixed a display glitch with the disclosure angle for the details view in survey and protocol lists.</li>
          <li>Fixed a bug where the editor was not presented when creating a new feature at the map touch location.</li>
          <li>Fixed a bug where the track log properties editor was not displayed at the proper times.</li>
          <li>Add default limits of 0..100 on the stepper control (for legacy compatibility).</li>
          <li>Disable the save button when there are no changes.</li>
          <li>Fixed a bug where mission properties at touch location were incorrectly drawn at the gps location.</li>
          <li>Now if you tap to select multiple features, and then delete one, it is removed from the list of selected
            features.
          </li>
          <li>The undo button while editing the survey name was confusing. It is now a &quot;clear text&quot; button and
            a
            new undo
            button was added.</li>
          <li>Made the totalizer and info banner more visible</li>
          <li>Made the totalizer with fields behave like the old Park Observer (shows total for entire survey not just
            current track
            log)</li>
          <li>The feature selector/presenter now shows the feature id in the title.</li>
          <li>Added support for the gps_interval property in the protocol file</li>
