          <h3>Quick Start</h3>

          <p>Park Observer is an iPhone/iPad application for collecting spatial data.
            It is <strong>not</strong> available on the app store.  It is only available
            to NPS users, or partners working on NPS projects.  If your device has
            access to the Arrowhead WiFi, then you can install the app by browsing
            to the downloads page of this website using your device's browser and following
            the instructions there, otherwise, see the
            <a href="../help2/install.html">Offline Installation Instruction.</a></p>

            <p>Installing Park Observer is usually the most difficult part of using
              the app.  After it is installed, you might be able to learn all you
              need to know just using the app. A short <a href="user_guide.html">user guide</a> is also available
              if you want to get the most out of the features of Park Observer  
            </p>

            <p>Once Park Observer is installed, you can immediately begin experimenting With
              the sample survey provided with the application provided you have internet
              access for the online base maps.  Online basemaps are provide for testing.
              Since most surveys are offline, you will need to install an <a href="../maps2/">existing basemap</a>
              of your survey area, or if one is not available then <a href="#new-map">create a new basemap</a>,
              and <a href="install.html#map-install">install</a> it.  The GIS team is able to help create basemaps.
            </p>

            <p>Before doing a real survey, you will need to either load an existing
              survey that you wish to add to, or create a new empty survey from a protocol file.
              A protocol file defines the features you will survey and their attributes.
              It also defines additional characteristics of the survey such as how locations
              are collected. You can load an <a href="../protocols2/">existing protocol file</a>, 
              or if there is not one
              suitable for your survey, then you can <a href="#new-protocol">create a new protocol file</a>
              and <a href="install.html#protocol-install">install</a> it.
              The GIS team is able to help create protocols.
