This file allows me to edit the content of the user_guide.html file in markdown.
This file is considered the source of the content for each of the sections
(aside from the header) in user_guide.html.

To update user_guide.html, copy/paste each of the sections from here to a
markdown to html converter and paste into the appropriate section of user_guide.html


## User Guide

This guide assume that you have the sample survey loaded and active.
It will be loaded and active by default when the app is installed.
If your device appears different than shown below, then you may
need to go to the configuration menu to activate the sample survey.
If you have no sample survey, then you can either delete and reinstall
Park Observer, or take the device back to the person who installed Park
Observer and ask them to reinstall the sample survey.
