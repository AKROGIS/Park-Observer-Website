      <h2>Installing iTunes on your PC</h2>

      <p><strong>BE WARNED:</strong> Getting iTunes installed and working correctly with the NPS/DOI software settings
        can be the most troublesome part of working with Park Observer. Please read these instructions
        carefully. The biggest source of trouble is using a version of iTunes that is incompatible with
        our network -- it may run, but doesn&#39;t connect correctly to your device, or does not allow
        application installation or file transfer.</p>
      <p>iTunes is a software application that runs on the PC to allow you to connect to your iOS device.
        You do not need an Apple Account, the Apple store, the music store or any thing else on-line.
        The functionality you need has nothing to do with music, so ignore everything you might know about iTunes.</p>
      <p>These instructions were written on September 2, 2020 with the following versions of software:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Windows 10 version 1809</li>
        <li>iTunes 12.10.8.5</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It is likely that these instructions will work with earlier versions of windows 10,
        but not earlier versions of iTunes, so don&#39;t bother trying.
        They may work with newer versions as well. If not, please contact us (see below),
        and let us know which versions are not working for you. We
        will investigate and update these instructions as necessary.</p>
      <p>To check your windows version:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>click the start menu</li>
        <li>type winver</li>
        <li>press the enter key</li>
      </ul>
      <p><a href="start menu">image</a>
        <a href="winver">image</a></p>
      <p>To check
        Do you have itunes already installed?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>click the windows icon, type itunes<ul>
            <li>if you see an option to download/install from web, you do not have it installed</li>
            <li>If you have itunes installed<ul>
                <li>uninstall it<ul>
                    <li>control panel<ul>
                        <li>program and features, sort by publisher (look for Apple and remove all Apple software)</li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>check:</li>
                <li>you only need to do the following if your version of itunes does not work correctly</li>
                <li>you should test before uninstalling and reinstalling</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>DO NOT Install itunes from the Apple website, This requires admin privileges, and is incompatible
        with the NPS settings for windows.</p>
      <p>Check the software center (start menu, type software, then return). You should be on the VPN to
        see all the applications available in the software center. If iTunes is in the
        list of Applications, then try installing from the software center. If it is not there
        then <strong>disconnect from the VPN</strong> and install from the Windows Store. You NPS username is now
        registered with the
        windows store by virtue of our new (outlook) email system. You do not need to be on the
        VPN to install from the windows store.</p>
      <p>If you are on the VPN, you may be able to launch the </p>
      <p>Click the start menu, type store, then return (This does not work when on the VPN)</p>
      <p>If you have logged in to the windows tore, you will be taken directly to the list of
        DOI applications. If not, you will need to log in with your network username (email address)
        This will take you to the &quot;Organizations sign on page&quot;</p>
      <p>Scroll down and look for the option to sign in with you PIV card. If not there, then
        sign in with your windows credentials and network password (This is the one you change every
        2 months, and hardly ever use) Enter the username and password, then press next. This should
        say &quot;For security reasons we require additional information to verify your account&quot; Scroll down
        and click the option &quot;Sign in with PIV card&quot;. Make sure your card is in the computer and enter you
        PIN when prompted.</p>
      <p>You should now be logged into Microsoft Store and see the list of DOI approved Apps.
        iTunes is in that list. Click on the iTunes icon to install it.</p>
      <p>When the download is complete you will get a notification in the lower right. click it to launch itunes</p>
      <p>Accept the license agreement and itunes should launch.</p>

      <h2>Connecting your device to iTunes</h2>

      <p><em>If you get any errors in this process and you cannot see your device in iTunes,
          the first thing to suspect is the version of iTunes on your PC.
          Please check the help page on <a href="#install-itunes">Installing iTunes</a> to ensure
          you are using the correct version. Delete and reinstall
          iTunes (<strong>per the instructions!</strong>) before continuing.</em></p>
      <p>Use a USB to lightning (charging) cable to connect your device to the PC.
        The first time you connect your device, you will see a notification that
        iTunes is setting up your device. You will see another notification when it is done.</p>
      <p>You will be asked if you want to allow the computer to access the device.
        Make sure your device is on and unlocked.</p>
      <p><img src="./install_images/itunes_request_access.png" alt="Allow computer access to device"></p>
      <p>Then click <code>continue</code>.</p>
      <p>You will be prompted on your device to trust the computer.</p>
      <p><img src="./install_images/ipad_trust_this_computer.jpeg" alt="iPad - Trust this computer?"></p>
      <p>Tap on <code>Trust</code> and enter your device pass code.</p>
      <p>You may then get prompted by iTunes to upgrade your device.</p>
      <p><img src="./install_images/itunes_upgrade_device.png" alt="iTunes - upgrade device"></p>
      <p>I encourage you to keep your device up to date, however you can skip this step
        (click <code>cancel</code>) and upgrade your device later if you want.
        I prefer to upgrade my device over WiFi, and not via iTunes.</p>
      <p>If your device is successfully connected to iTunes, you will see a mobile device
        icon in the top left of the iTunes screen</p>
      <p><img src="./install_images/itunes_select_device.png" alt="iTunes screen with device connected"></p>
      <p>You are now ready to <a href="#install-app">Install Park Observer</a>,

      <ul>
        <li>You will need to download the installation file (*.ipa) from the downloads

        <li>Ensure that your device is on and unlocked.</li>
        <li>Start iTunes on your PC: Start menu, type itunes, press enter key</li>
        <li>Connect your device to the PC.
          If you have trouble with this step, please check your version of iTunes

        because that will appears when you are over other parts of the screen.
        You need to see the blue highlight of your device name.</p>
      <p>Dropping the install file on the device in iTunes will begin the installation.</p>

      <h2>Launching Park Observer</h2>

      <p>Tap the Park Observer 2.0 icon <img src="./install_images/park_observer_icon.png" alt="Park Observer 2.0 icon">
        on your device.</p>
      <p>If this is a first install of Park Observer you will see this warning</p>
      <p><img src="./install_images/iphone_untrusted_enterprise_developer.jpeg" alt="Untrusted Enterprise Developer">
      </p>
      <p>In order for Park Observer to run on your device you must trust the developers
        at the National Park Service. You only need to do this once, so you will not see
        this warning if you have Park Observer 1.x or 2.x) already installed.</p>
      <p>To enable Park Observer, you must have internet access. The trust process requires
        validating the developer certificates in Park Observer with Apple&#39;s servers. Typically
        you cannot access Apple&#39;s servers from the Arrowhead WiFi, so if the following step
        fails, then either 1) turn off WiFi and use cellular data (if available on your device),
        or 2) connect to different WiFi (home, cafe, airport, etc.) and try again.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Launch the Settings app <img src="./install_images/iphone_settings_icon.jpeg" alt="Settings App Icon"></li>

          <p>This should complete the trust process. Return to the home screen and
            try running Park Observer again.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>If Park Observer launches successfully, you should see a screen like this:</p>
      <p> <img src="./install_images/ipad_initial_screen.jpeg" alt="Initial Screen"></p>
      <p>On the first tap
        of the <code>start track log</code> button <img src="./install_images/ipad_tracklog_button.jpeg"
          alt="Tracklog Button">
        or the <code>GPS</code> Button <img src="./install_images/ipad_gps_button.jpeg" alt="GPS Button">,
        you will be prompted to allow location services.</p>
      <p><img src="./install_images/ipad_allow_locations.jpeg" alt="Allow Location Services"></p>
      <p>You should tap <code>Allow While Using App</code>.
        Park Observer expects to use your GPS, and functionality will be greatly limited
        without location services.</p>
      <p>If you enable background track logging (in the settings menu) you will be prompted again.</p>
      <p><img src="./install_images/ipad_change_to_always_allow.jpeg" alt="Allow Location Services Always"></p>
      <p>Select <code>Change to Always Allow</code>. You may get prompted again in a few days to confirm that you
        are still OK with background location data collection. You can change your
        choice at any time in the settings application, and Park Observer should respond accordingly, however
        you may lose functionality.</p>
      <p>At this point you might want to <a href="#add-files">load your own protocols and basemaps</a>,
        or begin playing with the sample survey (See <a href="user_guide.html">Getting Started</a> for help).</p>
