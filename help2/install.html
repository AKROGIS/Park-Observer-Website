      <h2>Installing iTunes on your PC</h2>

      <p>iTunes is a software application that runs on the PC to allow you to connect to your iOS device.
        To use it with Park Observer, you do not need an Apple account, or access to the App Store,
        or any other online services. The functionality you need has nothing to do with music.</p>
      <p><strong>BE WARNED:</strong> Getting iTunes installed and working correctly with the NPS/DOI software settings
        can be the most troublesome part of working with Park Observer. Please read these instructions
        carefully. The biggest source of trouble is using a version of iTunes that is incompatible with
        our network -- it may run, but doesn&#39;t connect correctly to your device, or does not allow
        application installation or file transfer.</p>
      <p><strong>DO NOT install iTunes from the Apple website.</strong> The Apple version
        is incompatible with the NPS settings for Windows 10.</p>
      <p>If you already have iTunes installed, you can try to
        <a href="#connect-device">connect your device to iTunes</a>. If you are unable to connect to your
        device, or unable to <a href="#install-app">install Park Observer</a>, or
        <a href="#add-files">Add Files to Park Observer</a>, then
        uninstall iTunes, and install the latest version per these instructions.</p>
      <p>These instructions were written on September 2, 2020 with the following versions of software:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Windows 10 version 1809</li>
        <li>iTunes 12.10.8.5</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It is likely that these instructions will work with other versions if installed per the
        following instructions. If these instructions do not work for you,
        please let us know what problems you are having, as well as which version of Windows
        and iTunes you are using. We will investigate and update these instructions as necessary.</p>
      <h3 id="launch-the-windows-store">Launch the Windows Store</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Click the start menu <img src="./install_images/win_startmenu.png" alt="Windows Start Menu"></li>
        <li>Type <code>store</code></li>
        <li>Press the Enter key</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You will need to log into the Windows Store with your Microsoft Office 365
        account. This account is tied to your NPS network account, so you may log
        automatically. If not you might be prompted with something like this:</p>
      <p><img src="./install_images/win_store_signin1.png" alt="Windows Store Login1"></p>
      <p>or something like this:</p>
      <p><img src="./install_images/win_store_signin2.png" alt="Windows Store Login2"></p>
      <p>Clicking <code>Continue</code> or <code>Next</code> will take you the DOI authentication page:
        You will need to enter you network password (not your PIV PIN, but the one you have to change every 2 months)
      </p>
      <p><img src="./install_images/win_org_signin1.png" alt="DOI Signin 1"></p>
      <p>then click <code>Sign In</code>.
        You will then be told you need to provide additional information,
        Scroll down and click on <code>Sign in with PIV Card</code></p>
      <p><img src="./install_images/win_org_signin2.png" alt="DOI Signin 2"></p>
      <p>Make sure your PIV card is inserted in the computer, and enter
        your PIN when prompted.
        When you are logged into the Windows Store you should see something like the following:</p>
      <p><img src="./install_images/win_windows_store.png" alt="Windows Store"></p>
      <h3 id="download-itunes">Download iTunes</h3>
      <p>In the Windows Store, click on the iTunes option, and the download will begin.</p>
      <p><img src="./install_images/win_itunes_downloading.png" alt="iTunes Downloading"></p>
      <p>When the download is complete you will get a notification in the lower right.</p>
      <p><img src="./install_images/win_itunes_download_complete.png" alt="iTunes Downloaded"></p>
      <p>Click the <code>Launch</code> button. Accept the license agreement and iTunes should launch.</p>
      <p>Click <code>No Thanks</code> on the welcome screen</p>
      <p><img src="./install_images/win_itunes_welcome.png" alt="iTunes Welcome"></p>
      <p>Ignore the options to go to or sign in the the iTunes store. You do not need to log into the Apple Store, the
        iTunes store, or any other service. When iTunes finishes launching,
        you should see a screen similar to the following:</p>

      <h2>Connecting your device to iTunes</h2>

      <p><em>If you get any errors in this process and you cannot see your device in iTunes,
          the first thing to suspect is the version of iTunes on your PC.
          Please check the help page on <a href="#install-itunes">Installing iTunes</a> to ensure
          you are using the correct version. Delete and reinstall
          iTunes (<strong>per the instructions!</strong>) before continuing.</em></p>
      <p>Use a USB to lightning (charging) cable to connect your device to the PC.
        The first time you connect your device, you will see a notification that
        iTunes is setting up your device. You will see another notification when it is done.</p>
      <p>You will be asked if you want to allow the computer to access the device.
        Make sure your device is on and unlocked.</p>
      <p><img src="./install_images/itunes_request_access.png" alt="Allow computer access to device"></p>
      <p>Then click <code>continue</code>.</p>
      <p>You will be prompted on your device to trust the computer.</p>
      <p><img src="./install_images/ipad_trust_this_computer.jpeg" alt="iPad - Trust this computer?"></p>
      <p>Tap on <code>Trust</code> and enter your device pass code.</p>
      <p>You may then get prompted by iTunes to upgrade your device.</p>
      <p><img src="./install_images/itunes_upgrade_device.png" alt="iTunes - upgrade device"></p>
      <p>I encourage you to keep your device up to date, however you can skip this step
        (click <code>cancel</code>) and upgrade your device later if you want.
        I prefer to upgrade my device over WiFi, and not via iTunes.</p>
      <p>If your device is successfully connected to iTunes, you will see a mobile device
        icon in the top left of the iTunes screen</p>
      <p><img src="./install_images/itunes_select_device.png" alt="iTunes screen with device connected"></p>
      <p>You are now ready to <a href="#install-app">Install Park Observer</a>,

        after Park Observer has already been installed.</p>

    <article id="install-app">
      <h2>Installing Park Observer</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>You will need to download the installation file (*.ipa) from the downloads
          page to your desktop (or folder of your choice).</li>
        <li>Ensure that your device is on and unlocked.</li>
        <li>Start iTunes on your PC: Start menu, type itunes, press enter key</li>
        <li>Connect your device to the PC.
          If you have trouble with this step, please check your version of iTunes
          and the instructions for <a href="#install-itunes">Installing iTunes</a>,
          and <a href="#connect-device">connecting your device to the PC</a></li>

      </ul>
      <p><img src="./install_images/itunes_install_drop_zone.png" alt="iTunes Screen With Device Connected"></p>
      <p>This area will get a blue halo when the drop will work and the dragged file will
        display <code>Link</code> when it can be dropped. The dragged file will show a red &quot;no entry&quot;
        circle ( ðŸš«) when it cannot be dropped. It is not enough just to see the <code>Link</code> text,
        because that will appears when you are over other parts of the screen.
        You need to see the blue highlight of your device name.</p>
      <p>Dropping the install file on the device in iTunes will begin the installation.</p>
      <p><img src="./install_images/itunes_install_progress.png" alt="iTunes Installation Progress"></p>
      <p>If it complete successfully, you will have a Park Observer 2.0 icon <img

      <h2>Launching Park Observer</h2>

      <p>Tap the Park Observer 2.0 icon <img src="./install_images/park_observer_icon.png" alt="Park Observer 2.0 icon">
        on your device.</p>
      <p>If this is a first install of Park Observer you will see this warning</p>
      <p><img src="./install_images/iphone_untrusted_enterprise_developer.jpeg" alt="Untrusted Enterprise Developer">
      </p>
      <p>In order for Park Observer to run on your device you must trust the developers
        at the National Park Service. You only need to do this once, so you will not see
        this warning if you have Park Observer 1.x or 2.x) already installed.</p>
      <p>To enable Park Observer, you must have internet access. The trust process requires
        validating the developer certificates in Park Observer with Apple&#39;s servers. Typically
        you cannot access Apple&#39;s servers from the Arrowhead WiFi, so if the following step
        fails, then either 1) turn off WiFi and use cellular data (if available on your device),
        or 2) connect to different WiFi (home, cafe, airport, etc.) and try again.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Launch the Settings app <img src="./install_images/iphone_settings_icon.jpeg" alt="Settings App Icon"></li>
        <li>Select <code>General</code></li>
        <li>
          <p>At the bottom of the list, tap on <code>Device Management</code>, then <code>National Park Service</code>
          </p>

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Then tap on <code>Trust &quot;National Park Service&quot;</code></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>In the pop up alert box, tap on <code>Trust</code></p>

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>This should complete the trust process. Return to the home screen and
            try running Park Observer again.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>If Park Observer launches successfully, you should see a screen like this:</p>
      <p> <img src="./install_images/ipad_initial_screen.jpeg" alt="Initial Screen"></p>
      <p>On the first tap
        of the <code>start track log</code> button <img src="./install_images/ipad_tracklog_button.jpeg"
          alt="Tracklog Button">
        or the <code>GPS</code> Button <img src="./install_images/ipad_gps_button.jpeg" alt="GPS Button">,
        you will be prompted to allow location services.</p>
      <p><img src="./install_images/ipad_allow_locations.jpeg" alt="Allow Location Services"></p>
      <p>You should tap <code>Allow While Using App</code>.
        Park Observer expects to use your GPS, and functionality will be greatly limited
        without location services.</p>
      <p>If you enable background track logging (in the settings menu) you will be prompted again.</p>
      <p><img src="./install_images/ipad_change_to_always_allow.jpeg" alt="Allow Location Services Always"></p>
      <p>Select <code>Change to Always Allow</code>. You may get prompted again in a few days to confirm that you
        are still OK with background location data collection. You can change your
        choice at any time in the settings application, and Park Observer should respond accordingly, however
        you may lose functionality.</p>
      <p>At this point you might want to <a href="#add-files">load your own protocols and basemaps</a>,
        or begin playing with the sample survey (See <a href="user_guide.html">Getting Started</a> for help).</p>
